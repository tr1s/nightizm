      <p>An archive of singles that have been released at one point or another (that I could find) and then subsequently deleted. Now they're up here for good.</p>
      <p>This playlist will never be updated again, future singles will be left on their own and/or added to EP's / Albums if necessary.</p>
      <p>Most tracks are pretty accurate in terms of the time they were created, apart from Police Brutality. That was released recently, but created circa 2014. Plus there's one bonus song I don't think I ever released, but it felt like it belonged here.</p>
