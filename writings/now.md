## Nightizm

Motto: _Seize the Night_

### Location

Toronto, Ontario 🇨🇦

### What do you do?

Music producer, DJ, mixing engineer, web developer, software engineer, and all around digital creative.

### Why?

I live to create and inspire.

> You never know the impact you could have... if you put something out there.

### Currently working on?

Organizing my backlog of instrumentals and singles from 2013 – present and then releasing them to the public. After that’s done, we’ll see what the next Era of Nightizm will look like...
